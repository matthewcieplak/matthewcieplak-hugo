Most of my software experience has been in the world of web development. While I have always been an engineer, I have been responsible for leadership of many projects and teams, often taking on multiple roles. My primary software skills are:

 * Product and information architecture
 * Frontend development
 * Backend engineering
 * User experience design

I love working closely with designers and product managers to improve interfaces and create beautiful, standards-compliant, smooth-running software that exceeds' users expectations. The languages and tools I've used the most are:

 * Javascript (with Backbone & React)
 * Ruby (on Rails)
 * Python
 * Go
 * PHP
 * C++ (mostly on microcontrollers)

Of course, no web developer would be worth much without a deep knowledge and understanding of HTML, CSS, and other markup languages (I prefer to use SCSS). Along with those language fundamentals, I've also done a lot of server-side development and operations work, building projects with and making extensive use of these tools and platforms:

 * Amazon Web Services (EC2, RDS, S3, and Redshift)
 * MySQL, Postgres, & Redis
 * Hugo SSG (for this web site!)
 * Wordpress
 * Algolia
 * Varnish
 * Graphite, Grafana, and STATSD
 * Chef

 With web development I've spent a lot of time in working in particular with *audio libraries*, *advertising toolkits* and servers, and developing custom integrations through *external APIs*.
