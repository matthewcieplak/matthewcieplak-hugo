[Muxcloud](http://muxcloud.matthewcieplak.com/) is a lightweight Soundcloud client, named after the late, great [Muxtape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muxtape), a progenitor of many streaming websites that followed. I built it both to serve my own interest as a user and as an exercise in learning React. It allows a user to connect their Soundcloud account and then listen in to their feed with a custom dashboard.

Muxcloud adds power-user features like filtering your feed for reposts, remixes, and long sets, allowing bloggers and others to find new music without digging through endless reposts. The react.js/JSX source code is [available on Github](https://github.com/matthewcieplak/muxcloud).
