I had so much fun recreating that Daft Punk track last time I decided to come back for a second helping. Ten more in fact! I picked a decade of delicious synth treats from my music collection and spent a day recreating them on my homemade eurorack system. We modular nerds have a (perhaps deserved) reputation for being the noodly and undisciplined nomads of the synth world, so I wanted to show another side of the instrument!
