I built a new "Hex Drum" 6-channel trigger sequencer based on [Look Mum No Computer's classic "Big Button" design](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/projects#/big-button). It uses a custom etched enclosure and adds new features like presets, MIDI input, and clock output.

Sam's original [Big Button](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/projects#/big-button) design is a compact, flexible, powerful trigger sequencer with some unique and intuitive sequencing features. I wanted to hotrod it a little bit for live use so I rewrote the firmware, simplified the schematic, and added the extra MIDI i/o board to make it fully digitally compatible. 

[The updated code and schematics are available on my github page along with the custom enclosure design &rarr;](https://github.com/matthewcieplak/hexdrum-midi)
