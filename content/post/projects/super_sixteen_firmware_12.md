Another update for Super Sixteen adds paraphonic sequencing, external mutation control, and more!

<!--more--> 

Super Sixteen users can now download and install the latest firmware to gain access to these exciting new features:

- 3 new CV2 output modes - 2 paraphonic pitch modes (note and interval), and smoothed "LFO" mode (shift + CV knob)
- Use "RESET" input as an external trigger for the mutate button (button 11 in calibrate mode)
- "Audition" the selected note by triggering the gate output when the pitch is changed (shift + pitch knob)
- 4 new mutations - chord, chord (quantized), sub osc (for use with CV2 paraphonic mode) and vibrato.

[The firmware update is available on Github here &rarr;](https://github.com/matthewcieplak/super-sixteen/releases/tag/1.2)

A tutorial video an updated manual will be available soon!
