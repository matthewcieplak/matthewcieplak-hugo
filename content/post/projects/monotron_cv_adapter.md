I've completed a DIY project modding the Korg Monotron for analog CV input. I have found some other descriptions of similar mods online, but so far as I know Iâ€™m the first to document the build on video or provide PCB layouts, so while monotron hacks may be old hat, I think this brings something new to the table.

With full credit to <a href="www.dinsync.info/2010/06/how-to-modify-korg-monotron.html">DINsync</a> for documenting and experimenting with CV input to the monotron, I developed a new circuit using a simple potentiometer and transistor design to combine gate and pitch into a single "gate/pitch" signal to feed into the monotron.

This project received coverage in [CreateDigitalMusic](https://cdm.link/2019/09/monotron-cv-hack-video/) and [MatrixSynth](https://www.matrixsynth.com/2019/09/korg-monotron-cv-input-mod-eurorack.html).
