I built a new studio desk based on the [Platform Desk](https://output.com/products/platform) by Output. It has a monitor shelf, rack space for audio gear, and a sliding keyboard tray, with all plywood construction.  I drafted the cutout plans in QCAD and then produced a tutorial video.

The complete cutout plans for this desk are [available on my Patreon page](https://patreon.com/extralife), and have been built and tested by makers and builders around the world. They are available in a slightly modified version which uses only 2 sheets of plywood, or a full-size, fully-accurate reproduction which requires 3 sheets of plywood.
