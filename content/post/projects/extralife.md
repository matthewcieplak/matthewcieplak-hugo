Extralife is my ongoing musical project, with a focus on improvisation and DIY. I post regular videos on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd5402wsbVLJKc2fnU1VfFQ), including many single-session live recordings and original tracks.

Unlike previous projects, my newer music is focused more on songwriting, live instruments, and the joy of experimentation. I will often set rules for myself, like finishing a song in a single day, or limiting my sound selection, to help force myself into a more creative space.

With DIY videos, I try to incorporate some of my expertise with the process of actually learning new things on-camera, so viewers can share in the process of discovery. Often we learn more from our mistakes than from our successes.
