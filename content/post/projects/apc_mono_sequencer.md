The APC Mono Sequencer is a maxforlive device which combines Cycling 74's sequencer device with a dedicated hardware interface to Ableton's APC40 controller. It combines a grid-based step sequencer with encoder controls for the attributes of each note. It is available as a free download on [maxforlive.com](http://maxforlive.com/library/device/2644/apc-mono-sequencer).

The APC Mono Sequencer received coverage on [Synthtopia](https://www.synthtopia.com/content/2014/11/24/introducing-the-apc-mono-sequencer-max-for-live/), and [Zeroes and Ones](http://alijamieson.co.uk/2014/11/hacking-hardware-control-maxforlive/) were kind enough to let me write an article on its inner workings.
