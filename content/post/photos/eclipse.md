In August 2017, I traveled to South Carolina to observe the total solar eclipse. I brought with me an old Celestron C90 spotting telescope and my camera to see what I could capture. I was very lucky, as we found a secluded lakeside location to view the event and were just able to see totality before clouds descended on us.

50 miles away in Charlseton, rolling rainstorms obscured the entire event! I was able to capture some striking photos, but there is nothing like seeing it yourself. The ruby-red color of the solar prominences is extraordinary through a telescope, and the eerie quality of twilight at midday is unlike anything else. Check out my telescope photos below.
