# [8tracks](http://www.8tracks.com/)

[![8tracks](/img/sites/8tracks-thumb.png#thumbnail)](/img/sites/8tracks.jpg)
8tracks is a social playlist sharing site, where users can share and listen to mixes of their favorite music. Often compared to the original Muxtape, 8tracks is actually 100% legal, broadcasting under an internet radio license instead of the onerous on-demand type licensing used by competitors. It also links up with users' favorite web 2.0 services, like Twitter, Tumblr, and Last.fm. With a network of over 20,000 DJs and hundreds of thousands of listeners, 8tracks is one of the few digital music sites positioned to succeed in the volatile music industry. I do principal frontend development along with an excellent <a href="http://8tracks.com/team">team</a>. Ruby on Rails/MySQL. (2008-present)

Muxcloud is a lightweight Soundcloud client, which I built both to serve my own interest as a user and as an exercise in learning React. It allows a user to connect their Soundcloud account and then listen in to their feed with a custom dashboard. It adds power-user features like filtering your feed for reposts, remixes, and long sets, allowing bloggers and others to find new music without digging through endless reposts.
